### Agile Methodology

In my project, **xttrust Custom Merch**, I use Agile methodology to manage the development process efficiently. Here's how it is structured:

1. **Work in Short Cycles (Sprints)**
   - The project is divided into small, manageable sprints, each lasting between two days and one week. At the end of each sprint, the work is reviewed, and the next steps are planned.

2. **Define What to Build (User Stories)**
   - User stories are written to describe each feature or improvement needed. These stories outline tasks from the user’s perspective, clarifying the goals for each sprint.

3. **Daily Check-ins**
   - Quick daily updates are done to track progress, identify any issues, and stay focused on the goals of the current sprint.

4. **Plan the Sprint**
   - At the beginning of each sprint, I plan the user stories or tasks to be worked on, setting clear objectives and managing time effectively.

5. **Review and Get Feedback**
   - At the end of each sprint, the completed work is reviewed and feedback is gathered. This helps ensure the project stays on track and aligns with the desired goals.

6. **Reflect and Improve**
   - After each sprint, I reflect on the successes and areas for improvement. This retrospective helps me refine my approach for the next sprint.

7. **Stay Flexible**
   - I remain open to changes, adapting the plan as needed based on feedback or new requirements. This flexibility allows me to respond quickly to changes or challenges.

By using Agile methodology, the project is managed with regular progress checks, continuous improvement, and adjustments based on feedback. This approach ensures the project evolves efficiently and meets the defined objectives.

#### GitHub Projects/Board

The project uses a GitHub Project Board for task management, structured with columns such as Todo, In Progress, and Done.

## Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

To ensure a smooth deployment of the application on Heroku, follow these steps:

To ensure a smooth deployment of the application on Heroku, follow these steps:

1. **Update `requirements.txt`:**
   - Keep the `requirements.txt` file current to ensure all necessary Python modules are included and correctly configured. This file lists all the dependencies your project needs to run.

2. **Create a `Procfile`:**
   - A `Procfile` is essential for Heroku deployment. It should be set up to configure a Gunicorn web server for your application. An example entry in the `Procfile` might look like:
     ```
     web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi
     ```

3. **Configure `settings.py`:**
   - In `settings.py`, update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` list with your Heroku app's domain and `localhost`. For example:
     ```python
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
     ```
   - Ensure that all static files and directories are properly configured.

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Configure all necessary environment variables in your `env.py` file, which should be included in your `.gitignore` file to keep sensitive information secure. Make sure the following variables are set:
     - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
     - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
     - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
     - `DATABASE_URL`
     - `DEBUG`
     - `EMAIL_HOST_PASS`
     - `EMAIL_HOST_USER`
     - `SECRET_KEY`
     - `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
     - `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`
